popfilter is a transparent pop3 proxy that enable apply `on the fly' filters
to the messages that are retrieved. Enable virus detections, mail backup,
spam detection, mime sanitize.

Very convenient with poor mail user agents that doesn't support pipe messages
to programs and in enviroments where fetchmail and procmail are don't
available.

The project use POSIX functions. a win32 would be nice because the MUAs are so
limited.. (eg: is difficult to SpamAssasin from Outlook).
